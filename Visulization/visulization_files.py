This study aimed to identify ORs (odorant receptors) and Orco (odorant receptor coreceptor) genes in Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea), to explore the relative expression levels of these genes in different adult tissues and obtain information on highly expressed receptor proteins. Putative OR and Orco genes were identified from transcriptomic data previously obtained for S. zeamais using bioinformatics methods. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to compare the differences in expression in seven adult tissues (male antennae, female antennae, heads, thoraxes, abdomens, wings, and legs). The candidate OR and Orco gene sequences were analyzed, and the protein physicochemical properties were predicted. We identified 64 OR genes including the Orco gene. Forty-seven OR genes, including Orco, were over expressed in male or female antennae. Seventeen OR genes appeared to be expressed at elevated levels in male antennae. Twenty-nine genes were expressed at significantly elevated levels in female antennae. In total, 11 OR genes were selected for further sequence analysis. The selected proteins were structurally characterized, and bioinformatics analysis was performed. Overall, in this study, candidate ORs of S. zeamais have been identified for the first time, and these ORs could be molecular targets for interference in the insect olfactory system.',[(43,67,'Gene'),(169,172,'Gene'),(174,191,'Gene'),(197,201,'Gene'),(203,230,'Gene'),(457,459,'Gene'),(464,468,'Gene'),(773,775,'Gene'),(780,784,'Gene'),(891,893,'Gene'),(914,918,'Gene'),(937,939,'Gene'),(957,961,'Gene'),(991,993,'Gene'),(1021,1023,'Gene'),(1191,1193,'Gene'),(1377,1380,'Gene'),(1446,1449,'Gene')]),('Latrophilin mediates insecticides susceptibility and fecundity through two carboxylesterases, esterase4 and esterase6, in Tribolium castaneum. Latrophilin (LPH) is known as an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor which involved in multiple physiological processes in organisms. Previous studies showed that lph not only involved the susceptibility to anticholinesterase insecticides but also affected fecundity in Tribolium castaneum. However, its regulatory mechanisms in these biological processes are still not clear. Here, we identified two potential downstream carboxylesterase (cce) genes of Tclph, esterase4 and esterase6, and further characterized their interactions with Tclph. After treatment of T. castaneum larvae with carbofuran or dichlorvos insecticides, the transcript levels of Tcest4 and Tcest6 were significantly induced from 12 to 72 h. RNAi against Tcest4 or Tcest6 led to the higher mortality compared with the controls after the insecticides treatment, suggesting that these two genes play a vital role in detoxification of insecticides in T. castaneum. Furthermore, with insecticides exposure to Tclph knockdown beetles, the expression of Tcest4 was upregulated but Tcest6 was downregulated, indicating that beetles existed a compensatory response against the insecticides. Additionally, RNAi of Tcest6 resulted in 43% reductions in female egg laying and completely inhibited egg hatching, which showed the similar phenotype as that of Tclph knockdown. These results indicated that Tclph affected fecundity by positively regulating Tcest6 expression.

Embryonic terminal patterning and moulting are critical developmental processes in insects. In Drosophila and Tribolium both of these processes are regulated by the Torso-activation cassette (TAC). The TAC consists of a common receptor, Torso, ligands Trunk and prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), and the spatially restricted protein Torso-like, with combinations of these elements acting mechanistically to activate the receptor in different developmental contexts. In order to trace the evolutionary history of the TAC we determined the presence or absence of TAC components in the genomes of arthropods. Our analyses reveal that Torso, Trunk and PTTH are evolutionarily labile components of the TAC with multiple individual or combined losses occurring in the arthropod lineages leading to and within the insects. These losses are often correlated, with both ligands and receptor missing from the genome of the same species. We determine that the PTTH gene evolved in the common ancestor of Hemiptera and Holometabola, and is missing from the genomes of a number of species with experimentally demonstrated PTTH activity, implying another molecule may be involved in ecdysis in these species.

Efficacy of Metarhizium anisopliae strain (IMI330189) and Mad1 protein alone or in combination by feeding method to overcome immune-related enzymes and Toll-like pathway genes was investigated in migratory locust. M. anisopliae (IMI330189) is a potent and entomopathogenic fungal strain could be effectively used against insect pests. Similarly, Mad1 protein adheres to insect cuticle, causing virulence to insects. We confirmed maximum 55% of mortality when M. anisopliae (IMI330189) and Mad1 was applied in combination. Similarly, increased PO activity was observed in locust with combined dose of Mad1  +  IMI330189 whereas PO, POD, and SOD activities reduced using Mad1 independently. Four Toll-like signaling pathway genes (MyD88, Cactus, Pelle, and CaN) were investigated from midgut and body of the migratory locust after 72 h of treatments. Subsequently, the expression of MyD88 in the midgut and body significantly decreased with the application of Mad1 and Mad1  +  IMI330189. Performance of these treatments was absolutely non-consistent in both parts of insects. Meanwhile, IMI330189 significantly raised the expression of Cactus in both midgut and body. However, the combined treatment (Mad1  +  IMI330189) significantly reduced the Cactus expression in both body parts. Pelle expression was significantly increased in the midgut with the application of independent treatment of Mad1 and IMI330189 whereas the combined treatment (Mad1  +  IMI330189) suppressed the Pelle expression in midgut. Its expression level was absolutely higher in body with the application of IMI330189 and Mad1  +  IMI330189 only. On the other hand, Mad1 significantly increased the expression of CaN in midgut. However, all three treatments significantly affected and suppressed the expression of CaN gene in body of locust. This shows that the applications of M. anisopliae and Mad1 protein significantly affected Toll signaling pathway genes, which ultimately increased level of susceptibility of locust.

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of multifunctional enzymes that are involved in detoxification of electrophilic toxic compounds. Although the co-induced expression of GST genes by insecticides in insects has been documented in recent years, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are not understood. In this study, a total of thirty-one cytosolic S. exigua GSTs (SeGSTs) was cloned and identified. The bioinformatics and gene expression patterns were also analyzed. Out of them, SeGSTe9, SeGSTs6, SeGSTe1, SeGSTe6, SeGSTe8, SeGSTe14, and SeGSTd1 were significantly co-expressed following exposure to three insecticides (lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos and chlorantraniliprole). The analysis of upstream sequences revealed that all of these seven SeGSTs harbored CncC/Maf binding site. The luciferase reporter assay showed that the pGL3-SeGST promoter construct exhibited a significant increase in luciferase activities after exposure to insecticides, and mutation of CncC/Maf binding site diminish the induction effect. These data indicate that CncC/Maf pathway regulates the co-expression of GST genes in response to different insecticides in S. exigua. Insecticides significantly enhanced the ROS content and treatment with the ROS inhibitor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) decreased the insecticide-induced luciferase activities of the PGL3-GSTe6 promoter construct, but not the CncC-mutated construct.

BACKGROUND: The rice striped stem borer (SSB), Chilo suppressalis (Walker), which is one of the most economically important phytophagous pests, has developed resistance to multiple insecticides. The resistance of SSB against chlorantraniliprole has been investigated in detail. However, the mechanism of its metabolic resistance has rarely been studied. RESULTS: A field population from Wuhu City, China was used to establish chlorantraniliprole resistant and susceptible strains (WHR and WHS) by laboratory continuous selection. Enzyme activities data suggested the potential involvement of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in WHR. CYP6CV5, CYP9A68, CYP321F3, and CYP324A12 were significantly overexpressed in WHR (from 4.48 to 44.88-fold). These four P450 genes were expressed in the late developmental stages of WHR; however, they were almost absent during the egg stage. In addition, their expressions were much more sensitive to chlorantraniliprole induction in WHR than in WHS. Injection of individual and mixture dsRNAs reduced the expression of the four target genes (55.2-73.2% and 43.2-50.2%, respectively) and caused significant larvae mortality (55.1-65.1% and 88.2%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Multiple overexpressed P450 genes were potentially associated with chlorantraniliprole resistance, as confirmed by the RNA interference (RNAi) assay. Our findings suggested that metabolic resistance to chlorantraniliprole might be mediated by P450s.  2018 Society of Chemical Industry.',[(31,60,'Gene'),(737,766,'Gene'),(775,782,'Gene'),(784,791,'Gene'),(793,801,'Gene'),(807,816,'Gene')]),('Modular cis-regulatory logic of yellow gene expression in silkmoth larvae. Colour patterns in butterflies and moths are crucial traits for adaptation. Previous investigations have highlighted genes responsible for pigmentation (ie yellow and ebony). However, the mechanisms by which these genes are regulated in lepidopteran insects remain poorly understood. To elucidate this, molecular studies involving dipterans have largely analysed the cis-regulatory regions of pigmentation genes and have revealed cis-regulatory modularity. Here, we used well-developed transgenic techniques in Bombyx mori and demonstrated that cis-regulatory modularity controls tissue-specific expression of the yellow gene. We first identified which body parts are regulated by the yellow gene via black pigmentation. We then isolated three discrete regulatory elements driving tissue-specific gene expression in three regions of B. mori larvae. Finally, we found that there is no apparent sequence conservation of cis-regulatory regions between B. mori and Drosophila melanogaster, and no expression driven by the regulatory regions of one species when introduced into the other species. Therefore, the trans-regulatory landscapes of the yellow gene differ significantly between the two taxa. The results of this study confirm that lepidopteran species use cis-regulatory modules to control gene expression related to pigmentation, and represent a powerful cadre of transgenic tools for studying evolutionary developmental mechanisms.',[(32,38,'Gene'),(231,237,'Gene'),(242,247,'Gene'),(689,695,'Gene'),(760,766,'Gene'),(1217,1223,'Gene')]),('Targeting the potassium ion channel genes SK and SH as a novel approach for control of insect pests: efficacy and biosafety. BACKGROUND: Potassium ion channels play a critical role in the generation of electrical signals and thus provide potential targets for control of insect pests by RNA interference. RESULTS: Genes encoding the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK) and the voltage-gated potassium channel (SH) were knocked down in Tribolium castaneum by injection and oral delivery of dsRNA (dsTcSK and dsTcSH, respectively). Irrespective of the delivery mechanism a dose-dependent effect was observed for knockdown (KD) of gene expression and insect mortality for both genes. Larvae fed a 400  ng dsRNA  mg-1 diet showed significant gene (P  <  0.05) knockdown (98% and 83%) for SK and SH, respectively, with corresponding mortalities of 100% and 98% after 7 days. When injected (248.4 ng  larva-1 ), gene KD was 99% and 98% for SK and SH, causing 100% and 73.4% mortality, respectively. All developmental stages tested (larvae, early- and late-stage pupae and adults) showed an RNAi-sensitive response for both genes. LC50 values were lower for SK than SH, irrespective of delivery method, demonstrating that the knockdown of SK had a greater effect on larval mortality. Biosafety studies using adult honeybee Apis mellifera showed that there were no significant differences either in expression levels or mortality of honeybees orally dosed with dsTcSK and dsTcSH compared to control-fed bees. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the titre of deformed wing virus, used as a measure of immune suppression, between experimental and control bees.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying E93 regulation is poorly understood. In this study, we found that specific knockdown of the E93 gene in the Drosophila wing disrupted wing development. Analyzing ChIP-seq signals for E93 in Drosophila wing identified that the decapentaplegic (Dpp) gene was a potential downstream target of E93. ChIP-PCR analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that E93 could bind to the Dpp promoter and enhanced its activity. Furthermore, the expressions of Dpp and other components in the Dpp signaling pathway were upregulated following E93 overexpression in Drosophila S2 cells but were decreased after E93 knockdown in the wing. Moreover, the impairment of the Dpp signaling pathway phenocopied the defects of E93 knockdown on wing development.

Ecdysis is a vital process for insects, during which they shed the old cuticle in order to emerge as the following developmental stage. Given its relevance for survival and reproduction, ecdysis is tightly regulated by peptidic hormones that conform an interrelated neuromodulatory network. This network was studied in species that undergo a complete metamorphosis, but not in hemimetabola. In a recent work, we demonstrated that orcokinin neuropeptides are essential for ecdysis to occur in the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus. Here we performed gene silencing, quantitative PCR and in vitro treatments in order to study the interrelationships between RhoprOKs and hormones such as ecdysis triggering hormone, corazonin, eclosion hormone, crustacean cardioactive peptide and ecdysone. Our results suggest that RhoprOKs directly or indirectly regulate the expression of other genes. Whereas RhoprOKA is centrally involved in the regulation of gene expression, RhoprOKB is implicated in processes related to midgut physiology. Therefore, we propose that the different transcripts encoded in RhoprOK gene could integrate signaling cues, in order to coordinate the nutritional state with development and ecdysis.

Melanism in insects is important for their physical protection, immunoreactions, and sclerotization. The vetch aphid, Megoura viciae (Buckton), has relatively strong tanning in its prothorax, head, antennae, cornicles, and legs. It was hypothesized that M. viciae may sequester the high level of l-DOPA in its host Vicia faba to help in its melanization process for ecological adaptation. To confirm this hypothesis, the amount of l-DOPA in M. viciae was modified and quantified. We first generated a Trifolium repens (clover, low l-DOPA containing) host to cut off the extra l-DOPA intake by M. viciae. The rate-limiting tyrosine hydroxylase gene of M. viciae (MV-TH) was then cloned and analyzed. To further reduce the l-DOPA level in the insect, RNAi was used to downregulate the transcriptional level of MV-TH. Our results confirmed that M. viciae could indeed sequester l-DOPA in its body, and its ample storage of this amino acid could be the reason for the strong tanning of its body. M. viciae reared on T. repens could upregulate its MV-TH to enhance l-DOPA biosynthesis and thus maintain a high level of l-DOPA. The MV-TH repression by RNAi lasted for about 3  days, successfully decreasing the l-DOPA level. Aside from a slight decrease in exuvia tanning, no other obvious change in body appearance was detected in the RNAi-treated insect. Although M. viciae can obtain most of its l-DOPA directly from its original host, its internal l-DOPA synthetase is still functional, especially when extra l-DOPA is removed from the diet.

By bioinformatics, gene expression, and silencing techniques in T. infestans nymphs, we achieved sequence and functional characterization of two variants of the limpet transcription factor (Tilimpet) and studied their role as regulators of the AMP expression, particularly defensins, in fungus-infected insects. We found that Tilimpet variants may act differentially since they have divergent sequences and different relative expression ratios, suggesting that Tilimpet-2 could be the main regulator of the higher expressed defensins and Tilimpet-1 might play a complementary or more general role. Also, the six defensins (Tidef-1 to Tidef-6) exhibited different expression levels in fungus-infected nymphs, consistent with their phylogenetic clustering.

Ftz-f1 is an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. A 20-hydroxyecdysone pulse allows ftz-f1 gene expression, which then regulates the activity of downstream genes involved in major developmental progression events. In honeybees, the expression of genes like vitellogenin (vg), prophenoloxidase and juvenile hormone-esterase during late pharate-adult development is known to be hormonally controlled in both queens and workers by increasing juvenile hormone (JH) titres in the presence of declining levels of ecdysteroids. Since Ftz-f1 is known for mediating intracellular JH signalling, we hypothesized that ftz-f1 could mediate JH action during the pharate-adult development of honeybees, thus controlling the expression of these genes. Here, we show that ftz-f1 has caste-specific transcription profiles during this developmental period, with a peak coinciding with the increase in JH titre, and that its expression is upregulated by JH and downregulated by ecdysteroids. RNAi-mediated knock down of ftz-f1 showed that the expression of genes essential for adult development (e.g. vg and cuticular genes) depends on ftz-f1 expression.

UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs), as phase II detoxification enzymes, are widely distributed within living organisms and play vital roles in the biotransformation of endobiotics and xenobiotics in insects. Insects increase the expression of detoxification enzymes to cope with the stress of xenobiotics, including insecticides. However, the roles of UGTs in insecticide resistance are still seldom reported. In this study, two UGT inhibitors, namely, 5-nitrouracil and sulfinpyrazone, were found to synergistically increase the toxicity of imidacloprid in the resistant population of Diaphorina citri. Based on transcriptome data, a total of 17 putative UGTs were identified. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that fourteen of the 17 UGT genes were overexpressed in the resistant population relative to the susceptible population. Using RNA interference technology to knockdown six UGT genes, the results suggested that silencing the selected UGT375A1, UGT383A1, UGT383B1, and UGT384A1 genes dramatically increased the toxicity of imidacloprid in the resistant population. However, silencing the UGT362B1 and UGT379A1 genes did not result in a significant increase in the toxicity of imidacloprid in the resistant population.

Microplitis bicoloratus bracovirus (MbBV), a symbiotic virus harbored by the parasitoid wasp, Microplitis bicoloratus, suppresses innate immunity in parasitized Spodoptera litura. Here, we generated eIF4E dsRNA and used it to silence the eIF4E gene of S. litura, resulting in a hallmark immunosuppressive phenotype characterized by increased apoptosis of hemocytes and retardation of head capsule width development. In response to natural parasitism, loss of eIF4E function was associated with similar immunosuppression, and we detected no significant differences between the response to parasitism and treatment with eIF4E RNAi. Under MbBV infection, eIF4E overexpression significantly suppressed MbBV-induced increase in apoptosis and suppressed apoptosis to the same extent as co-expression of both eIF4E and eIF4A. There were no significant differences between MbBV-infected and uninfected larvae in which eIF4E was overexpressed. More importantly, in the eIF4E RNAi strain, eIF4A RNAi did not increase apoptosis.

Organisms exhibit a wide range of seasonal responses as adaptions to predictable annual changes in their environment. These changes are originally caused by the effect of the Earth s cycles around the sun and its axial tilt. Examples of seasonal responses include floration, migration, reproduction and diapause. In temperate climate zones, the most robust variable to predict seasons is the length of the day (i.e. the photoperiod). The first step to trigger photoperiodic driven responses involves measuring the duration of the light-dark phases, but the molecular clockwork performing this task is poorly characterized. Photopigments such as opsins are known to participate in light perception, being part of the machinery in charge of providing information about the luminous state of the surroundings. Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are paradigmatic photoperiodic insects, exhibiting a strong induction to diapause when the light regime mimics autumn conditions. The availability of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) genome has facilitated molecular approaches to understand the effect of light stimulus in the photoperiodic induction process. We have identified, experimentally validated and characterized the expression of the full opsin gene repertoire in the pea aphid. Among identified opsin genes in A. pisum, arthropsin is absent in most insects sequenced to date (except for dragonflies and two other hemipterans) but also present in a crustacean, an onychophoran and chelicerates. We have quantified the expression of these genes in aphids exposed to different photoperiodic conditions and at different times of the day and localized their transcripts in the aphid brain.

Ommochrome is the major source for eye coloration of all insect species so far examined.

Our previous study indicated that the karmoisin ortholog gene (Nl-karmoisin) product in the brown planthopper (BPH) was a monocarboxylate transporter, while not a PHS. Here, based on full-length complementary DNA, the cardinal ortholog gene in BPH (Nl-cardinal) product was predicted to be a haem peroxidase rather than a PHS. We suggest for the first time that neither karmoisin nor cardinal encodes the PHS, but whether PHS participates in BPH eye pigmentation needs further research. Nymphal RNA interference (RNAi) experiments showed that knockdown Nl-cardinal transcript led the BPH ocelli and compound eye to color change from brown to red, while knockdown Nl-karmoisin only made the ocelli present the red phenotype. Notably, not only the Nl-cardinal transcript, dscd injection (Nl-cardinal targeting double-stranded DNA (dsRNA)) also significantly reduced the Nl-karmoisin transcript by 33.7%, while dska (Nl-karmoisin targeting dsRNA) injection did not significantly change the Nl-cardinal transcript. Considering the above RNAi and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results, we propose that Nl-cardinal plays a more important role in ommochrome synthesis than Nl-karmoisin, and it may be an upstream gene of Nl-karmoisin.

Both ILPs exhibited similar expression patterns in most developmental stages, showing high expression levels in adult stage.

RESULTS: The inducible expression of CYP6CY19 was the highest among three genes, followed by those of CYP6CY22 and CYP6DA1. The regions from -687 to +586 bp of CYP6DA1, from -666 to +140 bp of CYP6CY19 and from -530 to +218 bp of CYP6CY22 were essential for basal transcriptional activity.

When the larvae were fed a 1.66% kojic acid (KA)-containing diet, the levels of the ZtPPO1 transcripts significantly increased by 2.79- and 3.39-fold in the whole larvae and cuticles, respectively, while the corresponding PO activity was significantly reduced; in addition, the larval and pupal durations were significantly prolonged; pupal weights were lowered; and abnormal phenotypes were observed. An in vitro inhibition experiment indicated that KA was an effective competitive inhibitor of PO in Z. tau. Additionally, the functional analysis showed that 20E could significantly up-regulate the expression of ZtPPO1, induce lower pupal weight, and advance pupation. Knockdown of the ZtPPO1 gene by RNAi significantly decreased mRNA levels after 24 h and led to low pupation rates and incomplete pupae with abnormal phenotypes during the larval-pupal interim period. These results proved that PO is important for the normal growth of Z. tau and that KA can disrupt the development of this pest insect.',[(30,48,'Gene'),(50,54,'Gene'),(338,342,'Gene'),(444,450,'Gene'),(626,632,'Gene'),(1156,1162,'Gene'),(1230,1236,'Gene')]),('Egf-like gene is essential for cuticle metabolism in the brown planthopper. Using the mass spectrometry analysis of cuticle casts of brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) and transcriptome analysis of BPH tissues, we identified a gigantic gene (50,922  bp, 16,973 aa) tentatively called Nlegf-like.

Nlegf-like encodes an integral membrane protein of 16,973 amino acid residues with 260 EGF-like repeats and 16 Ca2+-binding EGF repeats type (cbEGFs) in the extracellular portion. Nlegf-like was highly expressed in the integument and tended to peak at the middle stage or late stage of each nymph instar. Phylogenetic analysis showed this gene is conserved in many other insects. Different double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA interference targeting eight different regions of the Nlegf-like gene resulted in abnormal cuticle formation or molting and lethal phenotypes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the newly formed endocuticle was significantly thinner for RNAi-treated BPHs with phenotype of contracted abdomen, or the old cuticle could not be digested sufficiently for those with phenotype of slender body shape or died with molting difficulty when compared with the control group.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate various biological processes during insect development; however, their role in larval-pupal development in oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) remains unknown. In the current study, we address the biological function of a conserved miRNA, Bdo-Let-7 in the regulation of BdE75 gene, which belongs to the ecdysone signaling pathway and participates in the larval-pupal development in B. dorsalis. Using dual luciferase reporter assay in HEK293T cells we show that Bdo-Let-7 miRNA interacts with the 3  untranslated region of BdE75 gene and suppresses its expression. The Bdo-Let-7 and BdE75 are also co-expressed in the larval-pupal stages and in different tissues of B. dorsalis. In in vivo experiments, the injection of Bdo-Let-7 agomir and antagomir in third instar larvae down- and up-regulated the expression of BdE75, respectively. The 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) injection assay shows that 20E up-regulated the expression of Bdo-Let-7 on the 5th day of the larvae. Moreover, abnormal pupation and eclosion were observed after larval Bdo-Let-7 antagomir injection.

Many organisms have evolved a series of adaptions, such as dormancy or diapause in insects that enable them to withstand seasonally adverse conditions. In insects, photoperiodic signals received during the diapause induction phase have irreversible effect on diapause initiation. Insects continue to be exposed to diapause-inducing photoperiod after the diapause induction phase during diapause preparation before they enter diapause. However, how photoperiodic signals experienced during the diapause preparation phase (DPP) regulate diapause remains largely unclear. In this paper, we investigate this in the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi. The cabbage beetle is in many respects an ideal experimental model in which to investigate the effect of photoperiodic signals on the DPP because it has facultative reproductive diapause induced by long-day length and has differentiable diapause induction and preparation phases. We found that the lipid content of female cabbage beetles decreased after diapause-destined (DD) individuals were exposed to a diapause-inhibiting photoperiod during the DPP. Two circadian clock negative regulators, per and tim, were probably involved in the photoperiodic response of beetles during the DPP. Per and tim presented obvious oscillation of circadian rhythm and photoperiodic response during the DPP in DD females and knock-down of these genes in DD females caused their lipid content to decrease. Per and tim probably promote lipid accumulation by regulating the expression of genes that regulate lipogenesis and lipolysis. Moreover, decreased lipid accumulation caused by exposure to different photoperiods during the DPP was independent of juvenile hormone. In summary, these results suggest that photoperiodic signals received during the DPP influence lipid accumulation in DD insects. DD insects still have some ability to monitor photoperiodic changes during the DPP and per and tim are probably involved in regulating physiological responses to photoperiodic signals during diapause preparation. These results shed light on the relationship between photoperiodic signals and diapause preparation, and may provide new insights on both how to better utilize insects as resources and for pest management.',[(1313,1316,'Gene'),(1321,1324,'Gene'),(1406,1409,'Gene'),(1414,1417,'Gene'),(1608,1611,'Gene'),(1616,1619,'Gene'),(2087,2090,'Gene'),(2095,2098,'Gene')]),('Transcription factors CncC/Maf and AhR/ARNT coordinately regulate the expression of multiple GSTs conferring resistance to chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin in Spodoptera exigua. BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a superfamily of multifunctional dimeric proteins existing in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. They are involved in the detoxification of both endogenous and exogenous electrophiles, including insecticides. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of GST genes in insects are poorly understood. RESULTS: We first identified at least three GST genes involved in resistance to the insecticides chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin. Analysis of upstream sequences revealed that three GSTs (SeGSTo2, SeGSTe6 and SeGSTd3) harbor the same cap  n  collar C/muscle aponeurosis fibromatosis (CncC/Maf) binding site, and SeGSTo2 and SeGSTe6 contain the aryl hydrocarbon receptor/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (AhR/ARNT) binding site. Luciferase reporter assay showed co-transfection of reporter plasmid containing the SeGSTe6 promoter with CncC and/or Maf expressing constructs significantly boosted transcription. Similarly, AhR and/or ARNT expressing constructs also significantly increased the promoter activities. The co-transfection of mutated reporter plasmid with CncC/Maf or AhR/ARNT did not increase transcription activity anymore. Constitutive over-expression of CncC, Maf and AhR was also found in the HZ16 strain, which might be the molecular mechanism for up-regulated expression of multiple detoxification genes conferring resistance to insecticides.

The insect cuticle plays important roles in numerous physiological functions to protect the body from invasion of pathogens, physical injury and dehydration.

One of these genes, which encodes the cuticle protein BmCBP1, was additionally cloned, and its expression and location during the process of development and molting in B. mori were investigated. In total, 46 protein-coding genes were identified in the silkworm genome, including those encoding 15 cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with one CBD (CPAP1s), nine cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with three CBD (CPAP3s), 15 peritrophic membrane proteins (PMPs), four chitinases, and three chitin deacetylases, which contained at least one ChtBD2 domain. Microarray analysis indicated that CPAP-encoding genes were widely expressed in various tissues, whereas PMP genes were highly expressed in the midgut. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting showed that the cuticle protein BmCBP1 was highly expressed in the epidermis and head, particularly during molting and metamorphosis. An immunofluorescence study revealed that chitin co-localized with BmCBP1 at the epidermal surface during molting. Additionally, BmCBP1 was notably up-regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone treatment.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising method for controlling pest insects by silencing the expression of vital insect genes to interfere with development and physiology; however, certain insect Orders are resistant to this process. In this study, we set out to test the ability of in planta-expressed dsRNA synthesized within the plastids to silence gene expression in an insect recalcitrant to RNAi, the lepidopteran species, Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm). Using the Manduca vacuolar-type H+ ATPase subunit A (v-ATPaseA) gene as the target, we first evaluated RNAi efficiency of two dsRNA products of different lengths by directly feeding the in vitro-synthesized dsRNAs to M. sexta larvae. We found that a long dsRNA of 2222 bp was the most effective in inducing lethality and silencing the v-ATPaseA gene, when delivered orally in a water droplet. We further transformed the plastid genome of the M. sexta host plant, Nicotiana tabacum, to produce this long dsRNA in its plastids and performed bioassays with M. sexta larvae on the transplastomic plants. In the tested insects, the plastid-derived dsRNA had no effect on larval survival and no statistically significant effect on expression of the v-ATPaseA gene was observed. Comparison of the absolute quantities of the dsRNA present in transplastomic leaf tissue for v-ATPaseA and a control gene, GFP, of a shorter size, revealed a lower concentration for the long dsRNA product compared to the short control product. We suggest that stability and length of the dsRNA may have influenced the quantities produced in the plastids, resulting in inefficient RNAi in the tested insects. Our results imply that many factors dictate the effectiveness of in planta RNAi, including a likely trade-off effect as increasing the dsRNA product length may be countered by a reduction in the amount of dsRNA produced and accumulated in the plastids.',[(585,618,'Gene'),(620,629,'Gene')]),('Transgenic soybean plants expressing Spb18S dsRNA exhibit enhanced resistance to the soybean pod borer Leguminivora glycinivorella (Lepidoptera: Olethreutidae).

BACKGROUND: The green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is a devastating sap-sucking insect pest that damages many host plants worldwide and causes billions of dollars of crop losses. Induction of RNA interference (RNAi) through oral feeding of small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been demonstrated in aphids. Therefore, host-mediated delivery of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to vital structural genes of aphids has been envisaged as a tool for the development of resistance against this aphid species. RESULTS: Cuticular protein (CP) senses seasonal photoperiodism and drives a shift from clonal to sexual generation in aphids. Thus, attenuation of CP gene expression is likely to result in a different reproductive orientation in aphids and thereby affect their fecundity. A gene encoding CP in M. persicae has been targeted for RNAi-mediated knockdown. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing dsRNA homologous to the MyCP gene was developed. The dsRNA-transgenics produced gene-specific siRNAs fed by aphids infesting the transgenics. A reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) study revealed an attenuated level of transcripts of the CP gene in aphid nymphs reared on the transgenic plants. Decreased expression of the CP gene resulted in a noticeable decline in aphid fecundity on the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. CONCLUSION: Increasing genetic resistance is the only sustainable way of minimizing the use of toxic agrochemicals to protect plants. Host-mediated RNAi of important insect genes has been proposed as a potential avenue for developing crop resistance against insect pests.

Small non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in development, stress response and other cellular processes. Silkworm is an important model for studies on insect genetics and control of Lepidopterous pests. We have previously identified 189 novel intermediate-size ncRNAs in silkworm Bombyx mori, including 40 ncRNAs that showed altered expression in different developmental stages. Here we characterized the functions of these 40 ncRNAs by measuring their expressions in six tissues of the fifth instar larvae using Northern blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. We identified nine ncRNAs (four small nucleolar RNAs and five unclassified ncRNAs) that were enriched in silk gland, including four ncRNAs that showed silk gland-specific expression. We further showed that three of nine silk gland-enriched ncRNAs were predominantly expressed in the anterior silk gland, whereas another three ncRNAs were highly accumulated in the posterior silk gland, suggesting that they may play different roles in fibroin synthesis. Furthermore, an unclassified ncRNA, Bm-152, exhibited converse expression pattern with its antisense host gene gartenzwerg in diverse tissues, and might regulate the expression of gartenzwerg through RNA-protein complex. In addition, two silk gland-enriched ncRNAs Bm-102 and Bm-159 can be found in histone modification complex, which indicated that they might play roles through epigenetic modifications.

Muscle fatty acid binding protein (FABP) is a major cytosolic protein in flight muscle of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. FABP expression varies greatly during development and periods of increased fatty acid utilization, but the molecular mechanisms that regulate its expression are not known. In this study, the gene coding for locust muscle FABP was amplified by PCR and cloned, together with 1.2 kb of upstream sequence. The sequence coding for the 607 bp cDNA is interrupted by two introns of 12.7 and 2.9 kb, inserted in analogous positions as the first and third intron of the mammalian homologues. Both introns contain repetitive sequences also found in other locust genes, and the second intron contains a GT-microsatellite. The promoter sequence includes a canonical TATA box 24 bp upstream of the transcription start site. The upstream sequence contains various potential myocyte enhancer sequences and a 160 bp segment that is repeated three times. In database searches in the genome database of Drosophila melanogaster, a gene with the same gene organization and promoter structure was identified, likely the dipteran homologue of muscle FABP.

Dox-A2 is the reported but herein disputed structural locus for diphenol oxidase A2. Database searches identified Dox-A2 related gene sequences from 15 non-insect species from diverse groups. Phylogenetic trees based on alignments of inferred protein sequences, DNA, and protein motif searches and protein secondary structure predictions produced results consistent with expectations for genes that are orthologous. The only inconsistency was that the C-terminus appears to be more primitive in the yeasts than in plants. In mammals, plants, and yeast these genes have been shown to code for a non-ATPase subunit of the PA700 (19S) regulatory complex of 26S proteasome. The analyses indicated that the insect genes contain no divergent structural features, which taken within an appraisal of all available data, makes the reported alternative function highly improbable.

P. glaucus contains two nearly identical genes, CYP6B4v2 and CYP6B5v1, and P. polyxenes contains two related genes, CYP6B1v3 and CYP6B3v2. Except for CYP6B3v2, the substrate specificity of which has not yet been defined, each of the encoded cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) metabolizes an array of linear furanocoumarins. All four genes are transcriptionally induced in larvae by exposure to the furanocoumarin xanthotoxin; several are also induced by other furanocoumarins. Comparisons of the organizational structures of these genes indicate that all have the same intron/exon arrangement. Sequences in the promoter regions of the P. glaucus CYP6B4v2/CYP6B5v1 genes and the P. polyxenes CYP6B3v2 gene are similar but not identical to the -146 to -97 region of CYP6B1v3 gene, which contains a xanthotoxin-responsive element (XRE-xan) important for basal and xanthotoxin-inducible transcription of CYP6B1v3.

The mature hemolymph protein consists of 161 amino acids. Optimized alignments of this protein with apolipophorin-III from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, disclosed an overall sequence identity of only 29%, even though the two proteins are functionally equivalent.

Six amphipathic helical segments of varying length were identified in each protein using a newly described algorithm for detecting such secondary structures. The degree of sequence identity between the two insect apoproteins is considerably less than that observed among orthologous mammalian apolipoproteins. However, calculation of the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions indicates that the insect genes may be evolving at rates similar to the mammalian apolipoprotein genes.

Internal deletions and substitution mutations show that the TAAT repeat is only necessary for the maximal flavone inducibility, whereas the other two components are necessary for the basal and flavone-induced expression of CYP321A1. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrate that XRE-Fla specifically binds to H. zea fatbody cell nuclear extracts and flavone treatment increases the nuclear concentrations of the yet-to-be characterized transcription factors binding to XRE-Fla.

Two groups of furanocoumarin-inducible cytochrome p450 genes, the CYP6B4 group and the CYP6B17 group, characterized in two closely related tiger swallowtails, Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis, are induced to different extents, with generally higher levels of CYP6B transcripts in P. glaucus. To investigate the evolutionary history of these CYP6B genes in the context of their association with furanocoumarin detoxification, we isolated thirteen CYP6B genes from these species. Each of these genes contains an intron at a conserved position (1334 nucleotides from the translation start site), which varies in length due to three insertion/deletions. The proximal 5  end flanking sequence from the transcription initiation site is highly conserved (91-98% nt identity). The sequence 5  to -640 is significantly variable due largely to the presence of three insertion/deletions. The sequence at the 3  end of this region contains a putative xenobiotic response element to xanthotoxin (XRE-xan), important for basal and xanthotoxin-inducible transcription of the P. polyxenes CYP6B1v3 gene, and multiple elements known to regulate vertebrate phase I and II promoters, including an XRE-AhR (Xenobiotic Response Element to Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor), an OCT-1 element (octamer protein binding site), an ARE (Antioxidant Response Element), an EcRE (Ecdysone Response Element), and an imperfect PXR (Pregnane X Receptor) responsive element (PRE). Our analyses of CYP6B genes in these two species indicate that these genes are in an early stage of divergence and that differential exposure of these two species to chemically distinct host plants resulting from geographical isolation has had functional impacts not only on the coding regions of these genes but also on their promoter regions.

Osdsx(M) was specifically found in males, and contained an 852-bp ORF encoding a protein of 284 amino acids. Osdsx(FL) and Osdsx(FS) were found in females, and had the same 813-bp ORF encoding a protein of 271 amino acids. The Osdsx gene was inferred to have six exons and five introns. The variation in the transcript could be explained by the alternative splicing of Osdsx: Osdsx(M) was formed by the splicing of exons 1, 2, 5 and 6, Osdsx(FS) by the splicing of exons 1-4 and 6, and Osdsx(FL) by the splicing of exons 1-6.

In the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus, we have previously shown that period (per) plays an essential role in the rhythm generation. In the present study, we cloned cDNA of the clock gene timeless (tim) and investigated its role in the cricket circadian oscillatory mechanism using RNA interference. Molecular structure of the cricket tim has rather high similarity to those of other insect species. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that tim mRNA showed rhythmic expression in both LD and DD similar to that of per, peaking during the (subjective) night. When injected with tim double-stranded RNA (dstim), tim mRNA levels were significantly reduced and its circadian expression rhythm was eliminated. After the dstim treatment, however, adult crickets showed a clear locomotor rhythm in DD, with a free-running period significantly shorter than that of control crickets injected with Discosoma sp.

For the present work, we undertook the characterization of this new homolog, CfGasp, in an effort to identify its role during larval development. As shown for DmGasp, the C. fumiferana homolog was found to contain three type-2 chitin-binding domains (CBDs), which were also found in Gasp orthologs retrieved from GenBank. In a phylogenetic analysis, these Gasp proteins formed a tight cluster, distinct from the midgut-specific peritrophins with which they share the cysteine-containing CBDs so far considered absent from cuticular proteins. However, unlike what has been shown for peritrophins, CfGasp transcript levels were low in larval midguts and most abundant in epidermis, while they were low in trachea and ovaries. Transcript levels increased during larval molts in a pattern similar to that observed for exocuticular proteins in other insects.

Distinct patterns of selection found using estimates of dN/dS ratios across Drosophila Met and gce coding sequences, along with their incongruent temporal expression profiles in embryonic Drosophila melanogaster, illustrate avenues through which these genes have diverged within the Diptera. Additionally, we demonstrate that the annotated gene CG15032 is the 5  terminus of gce. In mosquitoes and beetles, a single Met-like homolog displays structural similarity to both Met and gce, and the intron locations are conserved with those of gce.

In contrast, when the larvae were fed with the food and then starved for 24h, the OnCht transcript level decreased by 1.8-fold but the transcript level of OnCHS2 increased by 1.8-fold. Furthermore, there was a negative relationship between OnCht transcript level and chitin content in the midgut. By using a feeding-based RNAi technique, we were able to reduce the OnCht transcript level by 63-64% in the larval midgut. Consequently, these larvae showed significantly increased chitin content (26%) in the PM but decreased larval body weight (54%) as compared with the control larvae fed on the diet containing GFP dsRNA. Therefore, for the first time, we provide strong evidence that OnCht plays an important role in regulating chitin content of the PM and subsequently affecting the growth and development of the ECB larvae.',[(15,24,'Gene'),(302,311,'Gene'),(447,456,'Gene')]),('All-trans retinoic acid affects subcellular localization of a novel BmNIF3l protein: functional deduce and tissue distribution of NIF3l gene from silkworm (Bombyx mori).

Northern blot hybridization indicated the presence of hsp90 transcripts in all tissues, but expression in the brain-subesophageal complex was especially pronounced. The genomic organization of hsp90 examined by Southern blot suggested the presence of a single copy of hsp90 in the H. zea genome.

We suggest that BmCAP-A isoforms have important functions during ovarian development, which involve not only the traditional roles in actin organization or cell-cell adhesion but also the regulation of secretion of chorion proteins and the sculpting of the chorion surface.',[(0,5,'Gene'),(459,464,'Gene'),(619,624,'Gene'),(629,634,'Gene'),(799,806,'Gene'),(1025,1032,'Gene'),(1104,1111,'Gene'),(1314,1321,'Gene'),(1453,1460,'Gene')]),('Brownie, a gene involved in building complex respiratory devices in insect eggshells. BACKGROUND: Insect eggshells must combine protection for the yolk and embryo with provisions for respiration and for the entry of sperm, which are ensured by aeropyles and micropyles, respectively. Insects which oviposit the eggs in an egg-case have a double problem of respiration as gas exchange then involves two barriers. An example of this situation is found in the cockroach Blattella germanica, where the aeropyle and the micropyle are combined in a complex structure called the sponge-like body. The sponge-like body has been well described morphologically, but nothing is known about how it is built up. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a library designed to find genes expressed during late chorion formation in B. germanica, we isolated the novel sequence Bg30009 (now called Brownie), which was outstanding due to its high copy number. In the present work, we show that Brownie is expressed in the follicle cells localized in the anterior pole of the oocyte in late choriogenesis. RNA interference (RNAi) of Brownie impaired correct formation of the sponge-like body and, as a result, the egg-case was also ill-formed and the eggs were not viable. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results indicate that the novel gene Brownie plays a pivotal role in building up the sponge-like body. Brownie is the first reported gene involved in the construction of complex eggshell respiratory structures.',[(0,7,'Gene'),(875,882,'Gene'),(970,977,'Gene'),(1108,1115,'Gene'),(1311,1318,'Gene'),(1377,1384,'Gene')]),('Digestive beta-glucosidases from the wood-feeding higher termite, Nasutitermes takasagoensis: intestinal distribution, molecular characterization, and alteration in sites of expression. beta-Glucosidase [EC 3.2.1.21] hydrolyzes cellobiose or cello-oligosaccharides into glucose during cellulose digestion in termites. SDS-PAGE and zymogram analyses of the digestive system in the higher termite Nasutitermes takasagoensis revealed that beta-glucosidase activity is localized in the salivary glands and midgut as dimeric glycoproteins. Degenerate PCR using primers based on the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the salivary beta-glucosidase resulted in cDNA fragments of 1.7 kb, encoding 489 amino acids with a sequence similar to glycosyl hydrolase family 1. Moreover, these primers amplified cDNA fragments from the midgut, and the deduced amino acid sequences are 87-91% identical to those of the salivary beta-glucosidases. Successful expression of the cDNAs in Escherichia coli implies that these sequences also encode functional beta-glucosidases. These results indicate that beta-glucosidases that primarily contribute to the digestive process of N. takasagoensis are produced in the midgut. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated the site-specific expression of beta-glucosidase mRNAs in the salivary glands and midgut. These results suggest that termites have developed the ability to produce beta-glucosidases in the midgut, as is the case for endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, in which the site of expression has shifted from the salivary glands of lower termites to the midgut of higher termites.',[(186,202,'Gene'),(436,452,'Gene'),(625,641,'Gene'),(732,750,'Gene'),(1036,1052,'Gene'),(1277,1293,'Gene')]),('RNAi of ace1 and ace2 in Blattella germanica reveals their differential contribution to acetylcholinesterase activity and sensitivity to insecticides. Cyclorrhapha insect genomes contain a single acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene while other insects contain at least two ace genes (ace1 and ace2). In this study we tested the hypothesis that the two ace paralogous from Blattella germanica have different contributions to AChE activity, using RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown each one individually. Paralogous-specific depletion of Bgace transcripts was evident in ganglia of injected cockroaches, although the effects at the protein level were less pronounced. Using spectrophotometric and zymogram measurements, we obtained evidence that BgAChE1 represents 65-75% of the total AChE activity in nerve tissue demonstrating that ace1 encodes a predominant AChE. A significant increase in sensitivity of Bgace1-interfered cockroaches was observed after 48 h of exposure to chlorpyrifos. In contrast, Bgace2 knockdown had a negligible effect on mortality to this organophosphate. These results point out a key role, qualitative and/or quantitative, of AChE1 as target of organophosphate insecticides in this species. Silencing the expression of Bgace1 but not Bgace2 also produced an increased mortality in insects when synergized with lambda-cyhalothrin, a situation which resembles the synergistic effects observed between organophosphates and pyrethroids. Gene silencing of ace genes by RNAi offers an exciting approach for examining a possible functional differentiation in ace paralogous.',[(8,12,'Gene'),(17,21,'Gene'),(281,285,'Gene'),(290,294,'Gene'),(831,835,'Gene')]),('Structure and expression of the silk adhesive protein Ser2 in Bombyx mori. Sericins are soluble silk components encoded in Bombyx mori by three genes, of which Ser1 and Ser3 have been characterized. The Ser1 and Ser3 proteins were shown to appear later in the last larval instar as the major sericins of cocoon silk. These proteins are, however, virtually absent in the highly adhesive silk spun prior to cocoon spinning, when the larvae construct a loose scaffold for cocoon attachment. We show here that the silk-gland lumen of the feeding last instar larvae contains two abundant adhesive proteins of 230 kDa and 120 kDa that were identified as products of the Ser2 gene. We also describe the sequence, exon-intron structure, alternative splicing and deduced translation products of this gene in the Daizo p50 strain of B. mori. Two mRNAs of 5.7 and 3.1 kb are generated by alternative splicing of the largest exon. The predicted mature proteins contain 1740 and 882 amino acid residues. The repetitive amino acid sequence encoded by exons 9a and 9b is apparently responsible for the adhesiveness of Ser2 products.

BACKGROUND: The coordinated action of genes that control patterning, cell fate determination, cell size, and cell adhesion is required for proper wing formation in Drosophila. Defects in any of these basic processes can lead to wing aberrations, including blisters. The xenicid mutation was originally identified in a screen designed to uncover regulators of adhesion between wing surfaces [1]. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we demonstrate that expression of the betaPS integrin or the patterning protein Engrailed are not affected in developing wing imaginal discs in xenicid mutants. Instead, expression of the homeotic protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is strongly increased in xenicid mutant cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that upregulation of Ubx transforms cells from a wing blade fate to a haltere fate, and that the presence of haltere cells within the wing blade is the primary defect leading to the adult wing phenotypes observed.',[(27,34,'Gene'),(86,106,'Gene'),(108,111,'Gene'),(384,391,'Gene'),(573,588,'Gene'),(615,624,'Gene'),(679,686,'Gene'),(740,753,'Gene'),(755,758,'Gene'),(785,792,'Gene'),(860,863,'Gene')]),('Functional analysis of saxophone, the Drosophila gene encoding the BMP type I receptor ortholog of human ALK1/ACVRL1 and ACVR1/ALK2. In metazoans, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) direct a myriad of developmental and adult homeostatic events through their heterotetrameric type I and type II receptor complexes. We examined 3 existing and 12 newly generated mutations in the Drosophila type I receptor gene, saxophone (sax), the ortholog of the human Activin Receptor-Like Kinase1 and -2 (ALK1/ACVRL1 and ALK2/ACVR1) genes. Our genetic analyses identified two distinct classes of sax alleles. The first class consists of homozygous viable gain-of-function (GOF) alleles that exhibit (1) synthetic lethality in combination with mutations in BMP pathway components, and (2) significant maternal effect lethality that can be rescued by an increased dosage of the BMP encoding gene, dpp+. In contrast, the second class consists of alleles that are recessive lethal and do not exhibit lethality in combination with mutations in other BMP pathway components. The alleles in this second class are clearly loss-of-function (LOF) with both complete and partial loss-of-function mutations represented. We find that one allele in the second class of recessive lethals exhibits dominant-negative behavior, albeit distinct from the GOF activity of the first class of viable alleles. On the basis of the fact that the first class of viable alleles can be reverted to lethality and on our ability to independently generate recessive lethal sax mutations, our analysis demonstrates that sax is an essential gene. Consistent with this conclusion, we find that a normal sax transcript is produced by saxP, a viable allele previously reported to be null, and that this allele can be reverted to lethality. Interestingly, we determine that two mutations in the first class of sax alleles show the same amino acid substitutions as mutations in the human receptors ALK1/ACVRl-1 and ACVR1/ALK2, responsible for cases of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2) and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), respectively.

Caspases are cysteine proteases that play critical roles in apoptosis and other key cellular processes. A mechanism of caspase regulation that has been described in mammals and nematodes involves caspase-like decoy molecules, enzymatically inactive caspase homologs that have arisen by gene duplication and acquired the ability to regulate other caspases. Caspase-like decoy molecules are not found in Drosophila melanogaster, raising the question of whether this type of caspase regulation exists in insects. Phylogenomic analysis of caspase genes from twelve Drosophila and three mosquito species revealed several examples of duplicated caspase homologs lacking critical catalytic residues, making them candidate caspase-like decoy molecules. One of these, CASPS18 from the mosquito Aedes aegypti, is a homolog of the D. melanogaster caspase Decay and contains substitutions in two critical amino acid positions, including the catalytic cysteine residue. As expected, CASPS18 lacked caspase activity, but co-expression of CASPS18 with a paralogous caspase, CASPS19, in mosquito cells or co-incubation of CASPS18 and CASPS19 recombinant proteins resulted in greatly enhanced CASPS19 activity.

This study examines the responses of heat shock protein transcripts, Hsp70 and Hsp90, to dehydration stress in three mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae and Culex pipiens. We first defined the water balance attributes of adult females of each species, monitored expression of the hsp transcripts in response to dehydration, and then knocked down expression of the transcripts using RNA interference (RNAi) to evaluate potential functions of the Hsps in maintenance of water balance. Fully hydrated females of all three species contained nearly the same amount of water (66-68%), but water loss rates differed among the species, with A. aegypti having the lowest water loss rate (2.6%/h), followed by C. pipiens (3.3%/h), and A. gambiae (5.1%/h). In all three species water could be replaced only by drinking water (or blood). Both A. aegypti and C. pipiens tolerated a loss of 36% of their body water, but A. gambiae was more vulnerable to water loss, tolerating a loss of only 29% of its body water. Dehydration elicited expression of hsp70 in all three species, but only C. pipiens continued to express this transcript during rehydration. Hsp90 was constitutively expressed and expression levels remained fairly constant during dehydration and rehydration, except expression was not noted during rehydration of C. pipiens. Injection of dsRNA to knock down expression of hsp70 (83% reduction) and hsp90 (46% reduction) in A. aegypti did not alter water content or water loss rates, but the dehydration tolerance was lower. Instead of surviving a 36% water loss, females were able to survive only a 28% water loss in response to RNAi directed against hsp70 and a 26% water loss when RNAi was directed against hsp90.
