 gene in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. A full-length 14-3-3 gene homolog (also referred to as the Px14-3-3 epsilon &quot; &quot; or Px14-3-3  gene) was cloned from cDNA of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. The Px14-3-3 transcript is 789 nucleotides in length, and the predicted polypeptide is 263 amino acids in length, with a calculated molecular mass of 29.6  kDa. The Px14-3-3 gene contains the typical and predicted 14-3-3 domains and motifs. The amino acid sequence of the diamondback moth 14-3-3 gene is very similar to that of other insect epsilons ( ) but not to other insect zetas ( ). In particular, the protein sequence of the Px14-3-3 gene shows high identity to the Bombyx mori epsilon (96.2%). Western blot analysis using an antibody against Px14-3-3  verified the expression of 14-3-3  in the larval, pupal, and adult stages. The Px14-3-3  expression patterns in all the different tissue types were examined in the fourth instar larvae. Px14-3-3  was detected in every tissue examined, including the body fat, hemocytes, brain, gut, and cuticle.</div>
