 (FABP) is a major cytosolic protein in flight muscle of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. FABP expression varies greatly during development and periods of increased fatty acid utilization, but the molecular mechanisms that regulate its expression are not known. In this study, the gene coding for locust muscle FABP was amplified by PCR and cloned, together with 1.2 kb of upstream sequence. The sequence coding for the 607 bp cDNA is interrupted by two introns of 12.7 and 2.9 kb, inserted in analogous positions as the first and third intron of the mammalian homologues. Both introns contain repetitive sequences also found in other locust genes, and the second intron contains a GT-microsatellite. The promoter sequence includes a canonical TATA box 24 bp upstream of the transcription start site. The upstream sequence contains various potential myocyte enhancer sequences and a 160 bp segment that is repeated three times. In database searches in the genome database of Drosophila melanogaster, a gene with the same gene organization and promoter structure was identified, likely the dipteran homologue of muscle FABP. Upstream of both insect genes, a conserved 19 bp inverted repeat sequence was detected. A similar but reverse palindrome is also present upstream of all mammalian heart FABP genes, possibly representing a novel element involved in muscle FABP expression.</div>
