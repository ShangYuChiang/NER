 (Rdl) locus in the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae), for use in sterile insect release. To ensure stability of the system, a recombination suppressing inversion can also be induced which encompasses the Rdl locus. As a first step, here we report the cloning of fragments of the Rdl gene from both An. stephensi and An. gambiae Giles using degenerate primers in the polymerase chain reaction. These fragments encode the second membrane-spanning region of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor and show high levels of both nucleotide and predicted amino acid identity to other Rdl-like receptors. They confirm that, as in all other arthropod species examined, dieldrin resistance in An. stephensi is associated with replacement of alanine302, in this case with a serine. In situ hybridization of the Rdl probe to polytene chromosomes of An. stephensi localizes the gene to the left arm of chromosome 3 (3L) in region 45C. Rdl localization will enable us to identify chromosomal rearrangements encompassing the Rdl locus and help anchor the genome sequence of An. gambiae to the polytene map.</div>
