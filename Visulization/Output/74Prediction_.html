<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Maelstrom is required to position the MTOC in stage 2-6 Drosophila oocytes. The factors that determine intracellular polarity are largely unknown. In Drosophila oocytes one of the earliest polar events is the positioning of the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). Here we present data that are consistent with the hypothesis that maelstrom is required for posterior positioning of the MTOC.</div>
